                        Digital Combat Simulator World (DCS World) is a free-to-play digital battlefield game.<br><br>
                        Our dream is to offer the most authentic simulation of military aircraft, ground and armor vehicles, and naval units possible. This free download includes a vast area of the Caucasus region as well as a free Mariana Islands map.<br><br> It includes one of the most powerful Mission Editors ever designed, network play, and hundreds of AI weapons systems, ground units, armored vehicles, air defense systems, and ships. It also includes a free Russian Sukhoi Su-25T ground attack jet and the famous WWII North American TF-51D Mustang fighter.<br><br>
                        DCS is a true "sandbox" simulation that is also designed to cover multiple time periods of interest such as WWII, Korean War, Vietnam, Gulf War and others.<br><br>
                        Current regions to battle include the Back Sea, Marianas, Nevada Test and Training Range, Persian Gulf, English Channel, Syria, and Normandy 1944.<br><br>
                        DCS World is a deep and realistic simulation that can be tailored to suit any level of experience. Our mission is to deliver excellence and make your dreams a virtual reality. We do this by offering training for complex weapons systems like the DCS:<br><br> F/A-18C Hornet, DCS: F-16C Viper, DCS: AH-64D, and many more. The next step is the real thing!
